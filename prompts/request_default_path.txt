When creaing iclargs.json in virtualc.cc 
if needs to be initialized to:

{
    "libraries": {
        "__default__": {
            "includes": [
                "$VIRTUAL_ENV/include"
            ],
            "lib_names": [

            ],
            "lib_paths": [
                "$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib"
            ]
        },
    }
}

$VIRTUAL_ENV this means path to virtual environment do not confuse it with literal string
Therefore you need to replace it with appropritate path

In icl.cc uninstall_library it must not be uninstalled
IN icl.cc list_libraries it must not be shown

__default__ is just for implementing so program should behave as it is not exists
However when user tries to install package name __default__, you we need to print error message

Also during initializing virtual environment, $VIRTUAL_ENV/include and $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib should be written in .iclignore
