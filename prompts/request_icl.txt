<First>
You have to make icl.cc
This file can receive 3 sub command "install", "uninstall" "list"
[Flow for "install"]
Other arguments will be provided (the number of arguments can be larger than one)
If not, then handle error
For each argument,
Argument is the name of library
Using pkg-config internally, you have to elicit the include path and lib path and lib name (-L, -l, -I) for that library
And Save them in the file "iclargs.json"
Use nlohmann json to manipulate json
Some path will exist in ".iclignore"
Each path wil be sepearted with enter (line seperater)
If path for (-L, -I) is same with path that exists in .iclignore, ignore it
[Flow for "uninstall"]
Other arguments will be provided (the number of arguments can be larger than one)
If not, then handle error
For each argument,
Argument is the name of library
Using pkg-config internally, you have to elicit the include path and lib path and lib name (-L, -l, -I) for that library
Then remove them from iclargs.json
[Flow for "list"]
List all name of installed libraries

<Second>
You have to make gcc.cc and g++.cc which are alternatives for gcc and g++
Path for original gcc and g++ will be stored in the environmental variable _GCC_PATH and _GXX_PATH
Forward arguments for gcc.cc/g++.cc to original gcc/g++
However, all arguments in iclargs.json must be added
