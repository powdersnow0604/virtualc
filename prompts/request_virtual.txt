[First]
Check whole project (Except files under prompts)
Most of files will be involved in this task

[Second]
Add virtual functionality
When creating virtual environment, environment vairable VIRTUALC_VIRTUAL_LIB which acts as boolean variable should be set
If VIRTUALC_VIRTUAL_LIB is true:
    pkg-config should only check .pc files under (virtual environment path)/lib/pkgconfig
    However we need to provide user option for additional path
    If installing new package by try_install_custom_library in icl.cc:
        new libs should be placed under (virtual environment path)
        For now, files related to package is installed under (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX),
        therefore, i think this can be implemented by using option to use (virtual environment path) rather than (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX)
If VIRTUALC_VIRTUAL_LIB is false:
    It works as before
    However, pkgconfig should also check .pc files under (virtual environment path)/lib/pkgconfig
