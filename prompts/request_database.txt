[First]
when building this project, you must clone https://github.com/powdersnow0604/linux_scripts.git this git repository,
and place the "libs" directory under CMAKE_INSTALL_PREIFX/virtualcdir directory
After that, delete other installed things

[Second]
When icl's subcommand is install, and the package cannot be found by pkg-config,
search CMAKE_INSTALL_PREIFX/virtualcdir/libs directory
For example, if package name is "abcd"
search for "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREIFX/virtualcdir/libs/ABCD"
and excute "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREIFX/virtualcdir/libs/ABCD/install_abcd.sh"
before excuting the shell script, you must get input about version number from user
it should be forwarded to shell script as first argument
If "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREIFX/virtualcdir/libs/ABCD/install_abcd.sh" returns successfully,
recheck the pkg-config and pkg-config found the package, install it else excute error handling logic
If "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREIFX/virtualcdir/libs/ABCD/install_abcd.sh" does not return successfully,
excute error handling logic

[Third]
When icl's subcommand is upgrade, reinstall "libs" directory from https://github.com/powdersnow0604/linux_scripts.git
